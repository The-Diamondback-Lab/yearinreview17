      "description": "University of Maryland Police incorrectly deployed pepper spray at a graduation party of predominantly black students, prompting outrage on social media and the two-week suspension of an officer. A five-week internal investigation did not discover evidence the incident was racially motivated, but some students disagreed. This incident occurred one week after Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, two black men, died at the hands of police officers. Read about UMPD’s investigation and watch body camera footage in The Diamondback’s coverage.",

Pruitt, who was the student affairs vice president at the time, the SGA proposed a plan to charge every student a mandatory fee that would help support this university’s underfunded Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct. The SGA ultimately withdrew the proposal in October but pledged to continue to advocate and raise funds for the office.",
